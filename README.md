# pandas-challenge
For this challenge, I referenced code from class activities, tutor support, and some online sources as follows: 
    - code for creating data frames came from class activities
    - code for selecting school types using set index came from tutor support
    - code fro creating groupbys came from class activities
    - codes for formatting and some formulas were already included in the starter code
    - online sources included: https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/file-formats/use-text-files/format-text-with-markdown-jupyter-notebook/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmchGbUlXTg, https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-convert-groupby-output-from-series-to-dataframe/
